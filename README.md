# RBM Toolbox

RBM toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for training RBM's.

 * Support for training RBM's with class labels including:
    * Generative training objective [2,7]
    * Discriminative training objective [2,7]
    * Hybrid training objective [2,7]
    * Semi-supervised learning [2,7]
 * CD - k (contrastive divergence k) [5]
 * PCD (persistent contrastive divergence) [6]
 * RBM/DBN sampling functions (pictures / movies)
 * RBM/DBN Classification support [2,7]
 * Regularization: L1, L2, maxL2norm, sparsity, early-stopping, dropout [3], momentum [1] 

The code in the toolbox is partly based on the DeepLearnToolbox by Rasmus Berg Palm. 

# Settings

The following section describes different settings for training in the RBM toolbox. 
Refer to `dbncreateopts` for a description of all settings.

## Training Objectives

The RBM toolbox supports four different RBM training objectives: Generative, discriminative, hybrid and semi-supervised learning.

The RBM training objective is set by specifying a function handle in `opts.train_func`. For all training objectives, except generative with `opts.classRBM==1`, y values are required. For training samples the y values needs to be giben with `opts.y_train` and for a optional validation set the x and y values are given with `opts.x_val` and `opts.y_val` respectively. Y values need to be onehot / one-of-K encoded. 

### Training objectives
Function handles are specified with `@training_objective_name`.  

* `rbmgenerative`    :  `-log(p(x))` or `-log(p(x,y))` if `classRBM` is 1
* `rbmdiscriminative`:  `-log(p(x I y))`   [7]
* `rbmhybrid`        :  `-(1-alpha)log(y I x) - alpha log(p (x) )`. The importance of the generative training objective is 
controlled with `opts.hybrid_alpha` [7]
* `rbmsemisuplearn`  :    `TYPE + beta unsupervised. Where type is {generative, discriminative,hybrid} and unsupervised is generative training on unlabeled data. The importance of unsupervised training is controlled with `opts.semisup_beta`. TYPE is specified with `opts.semisup_type = traintype` where `traintype is `{@rbmgenerative, @rbmdiscriminative, @rbmhybrid}`. Samples used for unsupervised training are given with `opts.x_semisup`.  See [7].

#### Generative training
Generative training and discriminative training are the basic training objectives in the RBM toolbox. The hybrid and semi-supervised training objectives are different combinations of generative and discriminative training. In generative training the negative log likelihood is optimized, depending on the setting of opts.classRBM that is either `-log(p(x))` or `-log(p(x,y))`.

Generative training can be trained with contrastive divergence (`CD`) [5] or with persistent contrastive divergence (`PCD`) [6]. The training type is specified with `opts.traintype`. Both CD and PCD samples negative statistics using Gibbs sampling. The number of Gibbs steps before the statistics is collected is specified with `opts.cdn`, one Gibbs step usually works fine.

#### Discriminative training
Discriminative training optimizes `p(y I x)`.

#### Hybrid training
Hybrid training combines generative and discriminative training objective. The two objectives are combined with:

`grads = grads_discrminative + opts.hybrid_alpha X grads_generative` 

#### Semi-supervised training
Semi-supervised training combines unsupervised and supervised training. The following formulae is used to combine the objectives:

`grads = grads_type + opts.semisup_beta * grads_generative`

Here `grads_type` is either the gradients from generative, discriminative or hybrid training. `grads_generative` is the gradients from unsupervised training on the samples given in `opts.x_semisup`. The gradients are calculated with Â´opts.classRBM=1`. We use samples of p(y I x) as labels for the unsupervised training.

## Learning rate and momentum

The learning rate is controlled with `opts.learningrate`. `opts.learningrate` should be a handle to a function taking current epoch and momentum as input, this allows for decaying learning rate.

Decaying learning rate can be specified with:   

```MATLAB
eps       		  = 0.001;    % initial learning rate
f                 = 0.99;      % learning rate decay
opts.learningrate = @(t,momentum) eps.*f.^t*(1-momentum);
```
Constant learning rate can be spcified with

```MATLAB
opts.learningrate = @(t,momentum) 0.01;
```

Momentum is controlled through `opts.momentum`. `opts.momentum` should be a function taking current epoch as input.

Ramp up momentum can be specified with:

```MATLAB
T             = 50;       % momentum ramp up epoch
p_f 		  = 0.9;    % final momentum
p_i           = 0.5;    % initial momentum
opts.momentum = @(t) ifelse(t < T, p_i*(1-t/T)+(t/T)*p_f,p_f);
```

Constant momentum can be specified with:

```MATLAB
opts.momentum = @(t) 0.9;
```

## Initial Weight Sizes

Initial weights are either sampled from a normal distribution [3] or from a uniform distribution [7], the behavior is controlled through `opts.init_type`:

```MATLAB
switch lower(opts.init_type)
    case 'gauss'
        initfunc = @(m,n) normrnd(0,0.01,m,n);
    case 'crbm'
        initfunc = @(m,n) (rand(m,n)-0.5) ./ max([m n]);
    otherwise
        error('init_type should be either gauss or cRBM');
end
```
Bias weights are always initialized to zero. 

## Regularization

The following regularization options are implemented

 * `opts.L1`: specify the regularization weight
 * `opts.L2`: specify the regularization weight
 * `opts.L2norm`: Maximum L2 norm for the incoming weights to each neuron [4]. Specify the maximum L2norm for each neuron
 * `opts.sparsity`: implemented as in [7]. Specify the sparsity being subtracted after each epoch.
 * `opts.dropout_hidden`: dropout on hidden units. Specify the probability of being dropped. see [1]
 * `opts.early_stopping`: Early stopping is available for classification RBM's where validation set is specified. The patience for early stopping can be set with `opts.patience`.

Setting a regularization value to 0 it.

## Hidden Layer Sizes

In the example a RBM with 500 hidden units is created and trained. You do not need to set the size of the visible units.

```MATLAB
sizes = [500];                        % hidden layer size
[opts, valid_fields] = dbncreateopts();   % create default opts struct
dbncheckopts(opts,valid_fields);          % simple check of validity of opts struct
dbn = dbnsetup(sizes, train_x, opts);     % create dbn struct
dbn = dbntrain(dbn, train_x, opts);       % train  dbn
```

You can stack several RBM by specifying sizes as a vector. `sizes = [500 200]` will stack two RBM's where the first RBM has 
#features visible units and 500 hidden units and the second RBM has 500 visible units and 200 hidden units. 
Any number of RBM's is allowed. If several RBM's are stacked non-top layer RBM's will be trained with generative training objective and `opts.classRBM = 0`.
 
## Settings table

The table shows which fields, in the opts struct, that applies to the different training objectives.

# Examples

## Example 1 - Generative Learning **p(x)**

Training RBM's in the RBM toolbox is controlled through three functions:
  * `dbncreateopts`: Creates an opts struct. The opts struct control learning rate, number of epochs, regularization, training type etc. The help for `dbncreateopts` describes all valid fields in the `opts` struct.
  * `dbnsetup`: Setups the DBN network, a single layer RBM is equal to a DBN. 
  * `dbntrain`: Trains the DBN

The following example trains a generative RBM with 500 hidden units and visualizes the found weights. Note that the learning rate is controlled through the `opts.learningrate` parameters. `opts.learningrate` is a function which takes the current epoch and current epoch as arguments and returns the learning rate. Similarly  `opts.momentum` is a function that controls the current momentum. When the `opts.train_func` is set to `@rbmgenerative` RBM outputs the reconstruction error after each epoch, the reconstruction error should not be interpreted as a measure of goodness of the model, see [3].

```MATLAB
rng('default');rng(0);
load mnist_uint8;
train_x = double(train_x)/255;
train_y = double(train_y);


sizes = [200];   % hidden layer size
[opts, valid_fields] = dbncreateopts();

opts.numepochs = 30;
opts.traintype = 'CD';
opts.classRBM = 0;
opts.y_train = train_y;
opts.test_interval = 1;
opts.train_func = @rbmgenerative;
opts.init_type = 'cRBM';

opts.learningrate = @(t,momentum) 0.05;
opts.momentum     = @(t) 0;

dbncheckopts(opts,valid_fields);       
disp(opts)
dbn = dbnsetup(sizes, train_x, opts); 
dbn = dbntrain(dbn, train_x, opts);

% visualize weights
figure;visualize(dbn.rbm{1}.W(1:144,:)'); 
set(gca,'visible','off');
```

## Example 2 - Classification RBM with generative training objective, **p(x,y)**

A classification RBM can be trained by setting `opts.classRBM` to 1 and setting `opts.y_train` to the training labels. The training labels must be *one-of-K* encoded.

When `opts.classRBM` is 1 RBM toolbox will report the training error. The default error measure is accuracy but you may supply custom error measures through `opts.error_func`. If `opts.x_val` and `opts.y_val` are given the validation error will also be reported.
In the example the validation error is calculated after each epoch, i.e. `opts.test_interval` is set 1. In the example we also enable early stopping, we use early stopping patience of 5, i.e. if no progress have been made in 5 epochs stop training.


```MATLAB
rng('default');rng(0);
load mnist_uint8;
train_x = double(train_x)/255;
test_x  = double(test_x)/255;
train_y = double(train_y);
test_y = double(test_y);

sizes = [200];  
[opts, valid_fields] = dbncreateopts();
opts.early_stopping = 1;
opts.patience = 5;

opts.numepochs = 50;
opts.traintype = 'CD';
opts.classRBM = 1;
opts.y_train = train_y;
opts.x_val = test_x;
opts.y_val = test_y;
opts.test_interval = 1;
opts.train_func = @rbmgenerative;
opts.init_type = 'cRBM';

opts.learningrate = @(t,momentum) 0.05;
opts.momentum     = @(t) 0;

dbncheckopts(opts,valid_fields);       
disp(opts)
dbn = dbnsetup(sizes, train_x, opts);  
dbn = dbntrain(dbn, train_x, opts);

% Make predictions
pred_val = dbnpredict(dbn,test_x);
labels_val = predict(test_y);
acc_val = mean(pred_val == labels_val);
err_val = 1-acc_val

% plot weights 
figure;visualize(dbn.rbm{1}.W(1:144,:)'); 
set(gca,'visible','off');


% plot errors
plot([dbn.rbm{1}.val_error',dbn.rbm{1}.train_error'])
legend({'Validation error','Train error'})
[min_val,min_idx] =  min(dbn.rbm{1}.val_error);
hold on; plot(min_idx,min_val,'xr'); hold off;
xlabel('Epoch'); ylabel('Error'); grid on;
```

For classification RBM's predictions can be calculated by `dbnpredict` wich returns a label or with 
`dbnclassprobs` wich returns the predicted class probabilities. 

The learned weights can be visualized with the `visualize` function.

The training error and validation error can be visualized as well:

<img src="/uploads/example2_error.png" height="350" width="350"> 

Note that in this example the validation error is lower than the training error, this is not typical. In the plot the 
red x indicate the lowest validation error. 

## Example 3 - PCD, Layers and Sampling

In example 3 we use PCD to train a classification DBN using the generative training objective. In the other examples `opts.traintype` has ben `CD` which mean contrastive divergence [5]. In this example we will use `PCD`, persistent contrastive divergence [6].
In CD the Gibbs chains are initiated at the data points, PCD differs from this by having a number of persistent chains which are used to initiate the Gibbs sampling.

```
clear all;
rng('default');rng(0);
load mnist_uint8;
train_x = double(train_x)/255;
test_x  = double(test_x)/255;
train_y = double(train_y);
test_y = double(test_y);

sizes = [200 ];   % hidden layer size
[opts, valid_fields] = dbncreateopts();
opts.early_stopping = 1;
opts.patience = 5;
opts.numepochs = 50;
opts.traintype = 'PCD';
opts.classRBM = 1;
opts.y_train = train_y;
opts.x_val = test_x;
opts.y_val = test_y;
opts.test_interval = 1;
opts.train_func = @rbmgenerative;

%% Set learningrate
eps       		  = 0.05;    % initial learning rate
f                 = 0.95;      % learning rate decay
opts.learningrate = @(t,momentum) eps.*f.^t*(1-momentum);

% Set momentum
T             = 50;       % momentum ramp up
p_f 		  = 0.9;    % final momentum
p_i           = 0.5;    % initial momentum
opts.momentum = @(t) ifelse(t < T, p_i*(1-t/T)+(t/T)*p_f,p_f);


dbncheckopts(opts,valid_fields);       %checks for validity of opts struct
dbn = dbnsetup(sizes, train_x, opts);  % train function 
dbn = dbntrain(dbn, train_x, opts);

% plot weights 
figure;visualize(dbn.rbm{1}.W(1:144,:)'); 
set(gca,'visible','off');

% sample digits
class_vec = zeros(100,size(train_y,2));
for i = 1:size(train_y,2)
    class_vec((i-1)*10+1:i*10,i) = 1;
end

digits = dbnsample(dbn,100,10000,class_vec); 
figure;visualize(digits'); 
set(gca,'visible','off');

% sampling movie
dbnsamplemovie(dbn,10,3000,'example3',10,@visualize,eye(10))
```

`dbnsample` can sample from the model. Samples of the digits 0-9, collected after 3000 Gibbs steps, are shown below:

`dbnsamplemovie` can be used to create a movie of the sampling process as the gibbs chains converge, somehow similar to http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/adi/index.htm .
